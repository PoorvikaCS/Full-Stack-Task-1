🏥 Secure Patient Medical Record Portal (Frontend Prototype)
A patient-centric, privacy-first web application prototype designed to demonstrate how individuals can securely manage and share their medical records across multiple hospitals without losing data ownership or privacy. This project focuses on UI/UX, consent-based access control, and security-aware design, not backend or cryptographic implementation.

📌 Problem Statement
Patients often receive treatment from multiple hospitals and clinics. Medical records are stored in isolated, centralized systems, leading to repeated medical tests, delayed diagnosis, poor emergency response, and high risk of data breaches. Centralized databases expose sensitive health data and reduce patient control.

🎯 Objective
To design a frontend-focused patient portal that gives patients full ownership of their medical data, allows secure, consent-based sharing of medical records, ensures the platform never accesses raw medical data, and visually communicates privacy, encryption, and trust.

🚀 Key Features
🧑‍⚕️ Patient Dashboard: Clean, trustworthy UI, high-level overview of medical records, encrypted data indicators, consent status visibility.
🕒 Medical History Timeline: Chronological view of patient medical events, unified presentation regardless of original format (JSON/XML/CSV), no exposure of raw medical data.
🔐 Access Control (Consent-Based): Patients can grant or revoke access, hospitals and services access data only with explicit consent, toggle-based permission management.
🛡️ Privacy & Security Awareness (Conceptual): Encrypted data status indicators, Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) support at design level, platform never reads unencrypted medical records, zero-trust UI design philosophy.
🚑 Emergency Access Mode: Explicitly triggered by the patient, time-bound access, biometric-style visual confirmation (UI simulation), automatic access expiration.

🧠 Design Principles
Patient-first ownership, consent-driven access, privacy by design, zero-trust architecture awareness, interoperability abstraction.

⚠️ Cryptographic algorithms are not implemented. This project focuses on design considerations and user experience only.
